QGIS translation manual
The "QGIS Documentation Japanese Translation Manual 2024" is an in-depth guide created by the Furuhashi Lab to support students and participants in translating QGIS Desktop user guides into Japanese using Transifex. QGIS, a widely used open-source GIS software, often has documentation primarily available in English, creating a language barrier for Japanese users. This manual addresses these challenges by providing step-by-step instructions on how to use Transifex, a translation management platform commonly adopted by open-source projects.

The manual begins by explaining the importance of QGIS's internationalization efforts (i18n) and why Japanese translations are crucial for expanding accessibility. It details the account registration process on Transifex, highlighting potential pitfalls and solutions, such as using GitHub to bypass certain registration restrictions. Additionally, the guide includes best practices for project participation and managing translation workflows to ensure high-quality outputs.

A key feature of the guide is its emphasis on collaboration through GitHub. By leveraging GitHub, participants can document their work, share insights, and address common issues encountered during translation. The GitHub repository serves as an open knowledge platform, encouraging participants to engage in discussions, post FAQs, and create markdown documents that simulate real-world collaboration. This environment helps both beginners and experienced users alike to enhance their skills, providing a hands-on learning experience that goes beyond traditional classroom instruction.

The manual also follows the JTF’s “Translation Guidelines,” ensuring that the translation efforts meet professional standards, particularly when dealing with open data. It breaks down the specific steps involved in translating QGIS documentation, including how to navigate po files within GitHub, a critical component for managing translations in GDAL. The guide also provides troubleshooting tips and common solutions, helping users maintain consistency and accuracy across all translated materials.

Furthermore, the manual explores the use of Sphinx, a documentation generation tool, which helps in publishing the translated documents while maintaining their original structure and quality. The Sphinx internationalization features are particularly highlighted, demonstrating how translated content can be managed effectively within a professional framework.

Overall, this project aims to bridge the language gap in geospatial technology by creating a comprehensive resource that supports the Japanese translation of essential QGIS documentation. By fostering an open knowledge-sharing culture, the initiative empowers students and participants to contribute meaningfully to the broader geospatial community. The project’s ultimate goal is to present these efforts at the FOSS4G International Conference, showcasing the impact of localization and collaborative learning on enhancing geospatial literacy for Japanese-speaking users.

GDAL translation
GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) is a versatile library and command-line tool used for converting and manipulating raster and vector data. It supports a wide range of geospatial data formats and is essential for data conversion, processing, and analysis in various GIS applications. The translation rules for GDAL documentation are aligned with those established for QGIS, ensuring consistency across these geospatial tools. GDAL translations are managed using po files on GitHub, facilitating collaborative updates and refinements. This approach allows contributors to work together efficiently, ensuring the documentation remains accurate and relevant.

By managing translations on GitHub, the GDAL community leverages version control, making it easier to track changes, address errors, and maintain high standards of quality across all translated content. This process enhances accessibility for Japanese-speaking users, promoting broader use of GDAL in academic, professional, and research environments. The GitHub repository serves as an open platform for sharing translation progress, encouraging community engagement, and providing a centralized location for all translation-related activities. This collaborative effort ensures that GDAL's powerful features are accessible to a wider audience, contributing to the overall growth and understanding of geospatial technology in different languages.
