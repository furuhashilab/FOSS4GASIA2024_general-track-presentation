## Abstract
Furuhashi Lab continues to input data into OpenStreetMap for emergency rescue efforts and as a contribution to areas without maps.

Creating and providing accurate maps requires not only proper instruction but also mastery of the editing tools used. In addition, using JOSM is an efficient way to input and validate huge amounts of data in OSM without errors.

JOSM (Java OpenStreetMap Editor) is an advanced OSM desktop editor, written in Java, that only works on Windows and Mac. And the printed manual is difficult for beginners to understand, and they often have trouble even getting the tool to work in the first place.

On the other hand, Visual information has the advantage of overcoming language barriers and differences due to prerequisite knowledge and can convey information intuitively. Furuhashi Lab uses the graphic recording as a means to achieve this.

Twelve students from Furuhashi Lab participated in the "OSM Data Validation Training Proposal" sponsored by UN Mappers over a three-month period from March to June. However, students who were not used to working with computers had a hard time just installing the system, and most of the students who participated actually faced problems. The graphic recording was created in such a situation. The graphic recording created in this situation did not capture the essence of the lecture, so we had to redo it. Afterwards, the video was reviewed and newly redrawn, which is now available to the whole world on GitHub.

Using the example of the graphic recording at JOSM Validation, I will introduce the usefulness of visualization in Japanese university education.
